/**
 * What updating Flarum itself would do to the extensions already installed.
 *
 * 🚨 This is the whole reason updating core is treated differently from
 * updating anything else. An extension update that fails is one extension; a
 * core update that fails is the forum. And the failure is not hypothetical —
 * Composer will simply refuse to resolve, at the end of a long wait, with a
 * wall of constraint text naming packages rather than extensions. Somebody then
 * has to work out which of their thirty extensions is the problem.
 *
 * So the question is asked BEFORE anything is pressed, and answered per
 * extension, by name.
 *
 * 🚨 The cheap answer first, and usually it is the only one needed. Whether the
 * version you ALREADY have supports the target core is written in composer.lock
 * — no network, no Composer, exact. Only extensions that fail that test cost an
 * HTTP call to ask whether a newer release would fix it. On a forum where most
 * extensions are already current, this is nearly free.
