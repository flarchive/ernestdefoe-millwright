 * One package's worth of change, as decided by the plan phase.

 * A plan is nothing more than a list of these. Keeping it that small is the
 * point: the applier never resolves anything, never asks Composer a question,
 * and never decides what should happen. It carries out a list it was handed, and
 * writes down what it did. That is what makes it testable without a network, a
 * Composer install, or a booted Flarum — and what makes an interruption
 * recoverable, because the record and the intention have the same shape.
