 * What changed between two composer.lock files.

 * 🚨 This is why an update here is cheap. Composer's own install path rebuilds a
 * whole tree; comparing locks says that exactly three packages moved, so exactly
 * three get downloaded and exactly three get replaced. Everything the design
 * claims — a rollback proportional to the change, an apply measured in renames
 * rather than minutes — follows from the plan being this specific.
 *
 * It is also the screen people see before they commit to anything. "Upgrading
 * fof/pwa, and pulling psr/clock in with it, because fof/pwa 2.0.0-beta.4
 * requires it" is a sentence somebody can make a decision about. A progress bar
 * is not.
