/**
 * Moving Flarum to its nightly build: which requirements change, and to what.
 *
 * 🚨 The update check never offers a branch to a forum on a tagged release —
 * rightly, as a badge — so a nightly cannot come from it. And the forum's own
 * composer.json cannot reach one either: `flarum/core: ^2.0.0-rc.8` with the
 * bundled extensions at `*` under `minimum-stability: beta` and
 * `prefer-stable` will never resolve to `2.x-dev`. Each requirement has to be
 * raised to the branch explicitly, which is also what grants that one package
 * dev stability.
 *
 * Core and the bundled extensions are split from one monorepo and move
 * together: core alone on nightly beside rc extensions is a combination
 * nobody tested. So every `flarum/*` package this forum REQUIRES that
 * publishes `{major}.x-dev` is moved, and nothing else. The branch name is
 * worked out here, on the server, from the installed core and Packagist —
 * never taken from a request.
 *
 * Undo is unchanged: composer.json is saved before the requirements are
 * raised, and putting it back returns the forum to the release it was on.
