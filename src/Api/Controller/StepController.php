/**
 * Advance the current run by exactly one unit of work.
 *
 * 🚨 This is what the admin page calls every couple of seconds, and it is why an
 * update finishes on a host that cuts every request at thirty seconds. It never
 * loops: one item, then it returns whatever it now knows.
 *
 * It also never lies by omission. A run that is finished says so; a run another
 * driver is holding says that too. Returning an unchanged run with no
 * explanation is the spinner problem, and the whole point of this extension is
 * not to have it.
