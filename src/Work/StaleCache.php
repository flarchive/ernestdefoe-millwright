/**
 * A cache somebody else owns, moved out of the way instead of refused.
 *
 * 🚨 Found on a Flarum-in-a-box container, 2026-10-07: its entrypoint runs
 * `php flarum` as root, so storage/cache and storage/formatter fill with
 * root-owned entries. Permissions refused every update over them, and "Put
 * everything back" failed at `cache:clear` for the same reason, on a host
 * where the operator may not have a shell to chown from.
 *
 * Neither directory holds anything worth keeping. When storage/ itself is
 * writable, renaming one aside is one call (a rename within the same parent
 * needs write permission on the parent only) and Flarum rebuilds what it
 * needs into a fresh one. Both halves of the formatter, the cached renderer
 * and the Renderer_<hash>.php it names, live in storage/formatter, so they go
 * together and never disagree. The old directory is left for root to delete:
 * this process cannot.
 *
 * When storage/ is not writable, or the directory is a mount point, the
 * offending entries are renamed hidden inside it instead (see setAside).
 * Only when neither is possible does Permissions refuse, as before.
