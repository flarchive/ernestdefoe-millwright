/**
 * Versions for packages Packagist has never heard of.
 *
 * 🚨 This exists because the check was silently useless for exactly the
 * extensions somebody paid for.
 *
 * `millwright:check` asks Packagist about every installed extension. A premium
 * extension is not on Packagist — it comes from a private Composer repository —
 * so it came back `uncheckable` and the forum was never told a new version
 * existed. On Ernest's two sites that was 7 and 9 packages, and they were the
 * paid ones.
 *
 * A private Composer repository is just `packages.json` at a URL, which is the
 * same shape Composer itself reads. So the fix is not special-cased to anybody:
 * whatever `composer` repositories the site has configured get asked, with
 * whatever credentials the site already has for them.
 *
 * 🚨 It fetches each repository ONCE per check, not once per package. A forum
 * with nine private extensions would otherwise be nine downloads of the same
 * index, on a schedule, for one question.
