/**
 * Runs one command and waits for it, without a shell.
 *
 * 🚨 An ARRAY command, never a string. proc_open with an array bypasses the
 * shell entirely, so a path containing a space is just a path — no quoting to
 * get right, and no way for anything to be re-parsed as a command.
 *
 * The version this replaced built a string with escapeshellcmd(), which escapes
 * shell metacharacters and does NOT quote spaces. On a machine whose PHP lives
 * under "Application Support" the command split at the space, and the error was
 * `sh: /Users/x/Library/Application: No such file or directory` — which names
 * neither the command that failed nor the reason.
 *
 * 🚨 Both pipes are drained as it runs. Reading stdout to completion before
 * touching stderr deadlocks the moment a command writes more to stderr than the
 * pipe buffer holds — rare enough to pass every test and then hang on somebody
 * else's host.
