/**
 * Runs Composer: in its own process where the host allows it, inside this one
 * where it does not.
 *
 * 🚨 A subprocess by preference. Extension Manager runs Composer inside the PHP
 * worker serving the request AND lets it rewrite vendor/, so a killed request
 * can take the vendor directory with it and a booted Flarum shares the
 * resolve's memory budget. Out of process, Composer gets its own limit, its own
 * lifetime, and its failures are exit codes rather than a dead worker.
 *
 * 🚨 In-process where a subprocess is impossible — proc_open disabled, or no
 * command-line PHP — and this used to refuse instead. What made Extension
 * Manager fragile was never the process Composer ran in: it was Composer
 * writing vendor/ from inside a request that could be killed. Millwright never
 * lets Composer touch a package directory. Composer only RESOLVES (`--no-install`
 * writes composer.lock and nothing else), Fetcher downloads, and Applier swaps
 * directories with journalled renames. The one write Composer makes here is the
 * autoloader at the register step, and ComposerSteps guards that separately.
 * So running the resolver in the request costs memory and time, both of which
 * are asked for and reported, and nothing that a kill can break.
 *
 * Shared hosting is where this matters: on IONOS/Plesk and most cPanel plans
 * proc_open is disabled for the website, and Millwright could not run there at
 * all.
