/**
 * Brings Composer's record of what is installed into line with the lock.
 *
 * 🚨 This exists so that the register step never makes Composer touch a file.
 *
 * Composer decides what to install by comparing composer.lock with
 * vendor/composer/installed.json — its own record — not with the disk. After
 * the staged apply the disk already matches the lock, but the record still
 * names the old versions, so a plain `composer install` re-extracts every
 * package this run changed.
 *
 * That re-extraction is not just slow, it can destroy the site. The Composer
 * Millwright runs is the one in the site's own vendor/, so when an update
 * includes Composer's own dependencies (symfony/finder, symfony/console, the
 * polyfills) Composer deletes the code it is running on, dies halfway with
 * `Class "Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder" not found`, and leaves those
 * packages as empty directories. wowcraft.online went down exactly like that
 * on a 33-package update, 2026-10-02: every page a fatal from the autoloader
 * requiring polyfill-php85/bootstrap.php out of an emptied directory.
 *
 * With the record rewritten from the lock first, `install` finds nothing to do
 * and only regenerates the autoloader, which is the part the step needs.
