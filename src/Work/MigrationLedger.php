/**
 * Which database migrations an update ran, so undoing it can reverse them.
 *
 * 🚨 Undo used to put the old CODE back over the new SCHEMA. Moving files is
 * all a rename can do, and a migration the update ran stays run: the older
 * version then boots against columns and tables it has never heard of, or
 * misses ones it needs. ClaudiusH asked the obvious question on 2026-10-07 —
 * "this should only be offered if the update did not include a migration,
 * right?" — and the honest answer was that the confirm box merely warned.
 *
 * So the update writes down what it ran, and undo reverses exactly those,
 * newest first, through each migration's own `down`. If any of them has no
 * down step, undo refuses before touching anything: old code on a newer
 * database is the outcome this exists to prevent.
 *
 * 🚨 In TWO requests, and from COPIES. Found undoing Flarum rc.8 → nightly,
 * 2026-10-07: nightly's API middleware reads the `asset_revisions` table its
 * own migration creates, on every response. Reversing that migration inside
 * the undo request — which still has nightly's code loaded — dropped the
 * table out from under the response, and the undo answered 500 halfway. So
 * the first request only checks, puts the files back and restores the
 * version Flarum records; the reversal runs in the NEXT request, booted from
 * the restored code. That code no longer contains the new migration files,
 * which is why the update keeps a copy of each one it ran.
 *
 * Recorded in two halves so a run killed mid-step still knows: the "before"
 * state is saved once, before migrate runs, and the difference is taken after.
