/**
 * Everything the update will have to change, checked before it changes any of it.
 *
 * 🚨 Both of these were found mid-run on real forums, 2026-10-02, and each was
 * worse for being found late:
 *
 * - A package directory owned by root. Moving a directory to another parent
 *   needs write permission on the DIRECTORY ITSELF (its `..` entry changes),
 *   not just on vendor/ — so the web user could not move ramon/chat aside, and
 *   the run stopped with four packages already swapped and Composer's record
 *   still naming the old ones.
 * - A root-owned file under storage/cache. Every package was in place, then
 *   the formatter could not be rebuilt and every discussion page 500'd until
 *   it was fixed by hand.
 *
 * Root-owned files appear whenever somebody runs `php flarum ...` or Composer
 * as root, which is routine on a VPS. They are cheap to find and impossible to
 * work around from inside PHP, so the answer is to refuse up front and say
 * exactly what to chown.
