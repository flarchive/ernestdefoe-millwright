 * Whether anything newer exists, asked cheaply.
 *
 * 🚨 This is deliberately NOT the same question as "can I have it".
 *
 * Extension Manager conflates them, and that is why its answers are so often
 * useless: a newer version existing tells you nothing about whether it will
 * install alongside everything else you have. Only a resolve knows that, and a
 * resolve is 16 seconds and 165 MB — far too expensive to run on a page load, or
 * on a schedule, or once per extension.
 *
 * So there are two answers, and they are kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   this class — "3.6.0 exists and you are on 3.5.0". One cheap HTTP call per
 *                package, cacheable, safe to run nightly. It is a HINT.
 *   the plan   — "here is exactly what changes, what comes with it, and what
 *                blocks it". Run when somebody actually presses Update.
 *
 * Presenting the hint as a promise would be the lie. The badge says a newer
 * version exists; pressing Update is what finds out whether you can have it.
