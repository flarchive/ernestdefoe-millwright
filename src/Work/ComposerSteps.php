/**
 * A real update, broken into pieces small enough that no single one needs a long
 * request.
 *
 * This is where the four phases stop being an idea and become Composer, HTTP and
 * renames. Nothing here is clever: the difficulty was all in making each unit
 * small, repeatable and honest, and that work is in LockDiff, Fetcher and
 * Applier. This class only says what the units are and in what order.
 *
 * 🚨 Every doItem() has to be safe to run twice. The driver saves progress AFTER
 * the work, so a process killed in between asks for the same item again on
 * resume. Fetch checks whether the package is already staged; apply's stash is a
 * no-op when the source is already gone; the finalise commands are all
 * idempotent by nature. That is a property to preserve, not an accident.
