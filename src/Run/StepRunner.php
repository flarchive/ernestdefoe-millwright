/**
 * Advances a run by exactly one unit of work.
 *
 * 🚨 This is the answer to the constraint that actually matters. Memory was
 * never the thing stopping updates on shared hosting — `max_execution_time` was,
 * and every other limit that punishes one long operation. So nothing here loops:
 * a call does one item and returns. Progress becomes a function of how many
 * times something calls step(), and it stops mattering whether that something is
 * the admin screen polling, a cron tick, or a queue worker.
 *
 * A host with a thirty second ceiling can therefore complete an update that
 * takes ten minutes, which no amount of optimisation would have achieved.
 *
 * Two rules it never breaks:
 *
 *   - **It always says what it did.** Calling step() on a finished run returns
 *     that run unchanged rather than doing nothing quietly. Silence is what makes
 *     a stuck update indistinguishable from a working one.
 *   - **It never skips work because something looks busy.** A stale run is
 *     reported to the caller with its age; it is not a reason to refuse. That
 *     refusal, done silently, is why one dead Extension Manager task blocks every
 *     later update forever.
