/**
 * Whether a package has a release that says it works with this Flarum.
 *
 * 🚨 The single most useful thing discovery can do, and the thing the current
 * tooling does not. Extension Manager lists everything on Packagist and lets you
 * find out at install time that an extension is Flarum 1 only — after the
 * resolve, after the wait, and with an error message about version constraints
 * rather than a sentence. Knowing before you press anything is most of the value.
 *
 * 🚨 Constraints are read with Composer's own parser, not a regular expression.
 * A Flarum extension's constraint is routinely `^1.8 || ^2.0`, or `>=1.8`, or
 * `^2.0@beta` — every hand-rolled matcher gets one of those wrong, and getting
 * it wrong means either hiding extensions that work or offering ones that
 * cannot. composer/composer is a dependency, so its parser is right here.
 *
 * This still says "declares", never "works". A declared constraint is the
 * author's claim, and whether the rest of your site allows it is a question only
 * the plan can answer.
