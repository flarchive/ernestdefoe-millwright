 * Finding extensions, in two cheap requests rather than one slow one.
 *
 * 🚨 The split is the design. Packagist's search tells you a package exists and
 * nothing about whether it works with your Flarum; that answer lives in each
 * package's own metadata file, one HTTP call per package. Doing all of it in the
 * request that serves a search means a dozen round trips before anything appears
 * — on a host that may cut the request at thirty seconds, for a screen somebody
 * is typing into.
 *
 * So search returns immediately with what search knows, and the verdicts are
 * asked for separately and cached. The screen fills in.
