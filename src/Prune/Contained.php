/**
 * Deleting things that live directly inside ONE directory, and nothing else.
 *
 * 🚨 This is the only code in Millwright that deletes a rollback copy, so it is
 * written to be incapable of three things, each of which has happened somewhere:
 *
 *   1. **Walking through a symlink.** A link is one thing to remove, never a
 *      door. Composer installs path repositories as links into a checkout, so a
 *      walker that follows them empties somebody's working tree. Every entry is
 *      `lstat`ed and a link is unlinked as itself — at the top and at every
 *      level below.
 *   2. **Leaving the directory it was given.** A name is one path component,
 *      never `..`, never containing a slash, and every directory it descends
 *      into must still resolve to somewhere strictly inside the base. Anything
 *      else is refused with an exception, not skipped quietly.
 *   3. **Using RecursiveDirectoryIterator.** Its link handling depends on flags
 *      and PHP versions; a hand-rolled walk over `scandir` + `lstat` has no
 *      behaviour that is not on this page.
