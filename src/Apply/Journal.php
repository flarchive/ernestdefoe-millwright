/**
 * An append-only record of what an apply has done, and what it was about to do.
 *
 * 🚨 This is the whole safety story. Everything else in Millwright is
 * convenience; if this file is wrong, an interrupted update is unrecoverable and
 * the product has no reason to exist.
 *
 * Two properties it has to have:
 *
 * 1. **Written before the act, not after.** Each change is recorded as `begun`
 *    and flushed to disk BEFORE the filesystem is touched, then marked `done`
 *    once it is. A crash therefore leaves evidence of an intention, which is
 *    recoverable; a journal written afterwards would leave a mutated tree with
 *    no record, which is not.
 *
 * 2. **Append-only, one JSON object per line.** A half-written final line is
 *    expected — that is what a killed process leaves — so reading tolerates it
 *    and discards it. A single JSON document would be corrupt in that situation
 *    and take the whole record with it.
 *
 * The sequence numbers are per-entry and monotonic, so replaying backwards is
 * just reading the lines in reverse.
