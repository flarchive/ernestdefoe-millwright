 * 🚨 It must work on a journal whose last entry is `begun` and not `done` —
 * that is the whole reason the journal is written before the act. That entry
 * describes a change that may have happened fully, partly, or not at all, and
 * the on-disk state is the only authority. So every step here is written to be
 * true whichever it was:
 *
 *   - restoring from the trash is skipped if the trash slot is empty
 *   - removing an added package is skipped if it is not there
 *   - a live directory is moved aside rather than deleted, even during a
 *     rollback, so a mistake here is still recoverable by hand
 *
 * Cost is proportional to the change, not the tree. Rolling back a
 * one-extension update moves one directory, which is why this works on a host
 * with a disk quota where copying vendor would not.
