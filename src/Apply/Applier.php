 *
 *     vendor/<pkg>   → trash/<pkg>@<version>     (the old one is kept)
 *     staging/<pkg>  → vendor/<pkg>              (the new one arrives)
 *
 * Both are `rename()`, so each is atomic and effectively instantaneous. The
 * package is absent between them, and only between them — microseconds, for one
 * package, against Extension Manager's window of deleting 1.3 GB and moving it
 * back. Nothing is deleted at all during an apply: the old tree waits in the
 * trash until somebody prunes it, which is what makes rollback possible long
 * after the fact.
 *
 * POSIX cannot swap two directories atomically, so two renames is the floor. It
 * is not worth reaching for something cleverer.
 *
 * The applier does not resolve, download, or decide anything. It is handed a
 * list and a staging directory, and its only job is to be interruptible.
