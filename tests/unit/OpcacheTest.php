/**
 * 🚨 The rule these protect: an update that cannot be seen has not happened.
 *
 * Everything else in this extension is about whether an update can RUN. This is
 * about whether anybody can tell that it did. On a host tuned with
 * `opcache.validate_timestamps=0`, new files land, every phase reports success,
 * and the site serves the old compiled code until PHP is restarted — silent,
 * total, and indistinguishable from the update never having run.
 *
 * The same fact is why this extension replaces directories in place rather than
 * flipping a symlink between prepared slots: `opcache.revalidate_path` is false
 * by default, so opcache resolves a symlink once and caches it. Slots would
 * trade a microsecond of a missing package for minutes of serving stale code.
