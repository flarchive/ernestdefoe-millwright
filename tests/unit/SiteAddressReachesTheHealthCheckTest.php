/**
 * The site address must be able to reach the health check.
 *
 * 🚨 This exists because it could not, for the entire life of the feature.
 *
 * `ComposerStepsFactory::__construct` took `?Config $config = null`, and the
 * single line that constructs it — the StepsFactory binding in the service
 * provider — passed only Paths. So `siteUrl()` returned '' on every install,
 * every run logged "No site address is configured, so this update will not be
 * judged by whether the site answers", and the automatic
 * rollback-when-the-site-breaks never ran anywhere.
 *
 * Nothing threw. An optional dependency that nobody supplies is indistinguishable
 * from one that is not needed, which is exactly why this is now required and
 * why that is asserted rather than assumed.
