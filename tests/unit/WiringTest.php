/**
 * The application actually assembles the things the other tests exercise.
 *
 * 🚨 THIS IS THE TEST THAT WAS MISSING, and its absence is the most expensive
 * mistake in this codebase so far.
 *
 * Every other test here builds its subject by hand, which means a unit can be
 * perfectly correct, perfectly tested, and never reached. That is exactly what
 * happened: `AutoRollbackTest` proved `Verdict::from()` decides correctly, and
 * passed on every run, while the automatic rollback was disconnected on every
 * install in the world — because the binding that builds the steps did not pass
 * the Config they need to know the site's address.
 *
 * A test that constructs its own subject cannot see that. This one resolves
 * from the container the way the application does, and asserts the graph is
 * whole.
