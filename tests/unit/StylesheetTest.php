/**
 * The stylesheets compile with the compiler Flarum actually uses.
 *
 * 🚨 less.php and less.js do not agree, and the disagreement is not academic.
 * `minmax(min(100%, 280px), 1fr)` builds happily under node and throws
 * "incompatible types" under less.php — LESS has a `min()` of its own and will
 * not compare a percentage with a pixel length. Flarum compiles every
 * extension's LESS into ONE bundle, so a stylesheet that will not build takes
 * the whole forum's CSS with it and the site serves an unstyled 500.
 *
 * That happened. The build was green, node said fine, and the site was down.
