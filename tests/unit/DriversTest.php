/**
 * 🚨 The rule these protect: a queue makes an update carry on in the background,
 * and is never what makes it work.
 *
 * Every failure here has to fall back to polling rather than refuse the update.
 * Refusing work because a background system nobody asked about is unhappy is
 * precisely the behaviour being replaced — it is why one dead Extension Manager
 * job blocks every later update forever.
 *
 * Mocks rather than hand-written stubs: these interfaces gain methods between
 * Laravel releases, and a stub that has to be chased every time tests less than
 * it costs.
