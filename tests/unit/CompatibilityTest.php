/**
 * 🚨 The rule these protect: "not for this Flarum" is a claim, and a claim must
 * never be manufactured by a failure.
 *
 * The bug that made this file necessary: `admits()` caught \Throwable, so when
 * composer/semver was missing from the autoloader every Error was swallowed and
 * EVERY package came back "not for this Flarum". Confident, wrong, and with
 * nothing on screen to suggest that nothing had actually been checked. Found by
 * running the endpoint against the real forum, where the verdict for an
 * extension that was installed and working came back "no".
