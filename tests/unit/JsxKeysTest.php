/**
 * 🚨 A static `key` on a static child has broken this extension's admin screen
 * three separate times, each one presenting as an endless loading spinner.
 *
 * Mithril requires that within one list of children, either every vnode has a
 * key or none does — and `null` (from a `cond ? x : null`) counts as one
 * WITHOUT. Mixing them throws during view; a throw during view renders nothing,
 * so whatever was on screen stays there, which is invariably the spinner. The
 * screen looks hung and the console holds the only evidence.
 *
 * Keys exist to track identity across reorders, which is `.map()` and nothing
 * else. A static child never needs one. So the rule is mechanical: no literal
 * `key="..."` anywhere. Then no children list can mix, because nothing static
 * is keyed, and this class of bug cannot recur.
 *
 * A PHP test guarding TypeScript is odd, but this suite is what runs on every
 * commit, and a rule nothing checks is a rule that lasts until the next time.
