/*
 * Advances a run a few times, then dies abruptly — standing in for a request
 * that the host cut off, or a browser tab that was closed.
 *
 * Each completed item is appended to a log file so the test can see, across
 * many processes, that everything was done.
 *
 * argv: <dir> <runId> <itemsJson> <logPath> <stepsBeforeDying> [killInsideItem]
 *
 * killInsideItem dies BETWEEN doing an item and the driver recording it — the
 * one gap where work is repeated on resume, and therefore the only place
 * idempotency is actually load-bearing. Killing after a step returns proves
 * cross-process resumption but never touches it.
