# Millwright

Update, install and remove Flarum extensions — and Flarum itself — on any host,
including shared hosting.

**Nothing is deleted, and every step is written down before it is taken.** An
interrupted update costs you progress, never your site.

---

## Requirements

- Flarum **2.0** or newer
- PHP **8.3+**
- Nothing else. Where PHP may start a subprocess (`proc_open`), Composer runs in
  its own process. Where it may not, as on most shared hosting, Composer runs
  inside the web request instead (see below). Millwright → This host says which.

Composer ships with Millwright, so your host does not need it installed.

## Install

```bash
composer require ernestdefoe/millwright
```

Then enable it from **Administration → Extensions**.

## What it does

**Updates extensions.** One at a time, or everything with a newer version in one
resolve — which matters, because two extensions can each have an update and
still be uninstallable side by side. Asking about them together is the only way
to find that out before anything moves.

**Installs new ones.** Search Packagist from the admin page, and every result
says whether it has a release that works with **the Flarum you are actually
running** — before you press anything, rather than as a constraint error at the
end of a long wait.

**Removes them.** The same operation as any other, so the files go to the trash
rather than being deleted, and an uninstall is as reversible as an update. Your
settings and any data the extension stored are left alone: reinstalling puts you
back exactly where you were.

**Updates Flarum itself** — and first tells you, per extension and by name, which
of yours have a release that works with the version you are moving to. Anything
that would block the upgrade is listed at the top, and the button stays disabled
until it is resolved. Extensions that need to move are updated in the same
resolve as core, because updating core alone leaves Composer refusing.

**Tells you what your host will allow, before you press anything.** Memory,
execution limit, whether Composer can be run at all, whether PHP will even notice
the new files, and how much disk is free — each with what it *means*, not just
what it is.

**Checks for newer versions** on a schedule, and puts a count on the dashboard.
The wording is deliberate: it says a newer version *exists*, never that an update
*is available*. Only a real resolve knows the second, and a badge that overstates
itself is one people learn to ignore.

**Finishes the job.** Moving the files is the easy half. After a change lands,
Millwright registers it with Composer, runs any migrations it brought, publishes
its assets, clears the caches and rebuilds the post formatter, waits for PHP to
re-read the new files, and then asks the site whether it is still answering. Only
then does it say the update is done.

That last pair matters more than it sounds. A tool that reports success the
moment Composer exits is reporting on a site that may still be executing the
previous version of the files for up to a minute — and if the update broke
something, nobody finds out from the tool.

**Survives being run as root.** `php flarum …` typed as root writes root-owned
files into `storage/` that the web user can never replace — removing a file needs
write permission on its *directory*, and that is root's too. The formatter cache
is the usual casualty: posts stop rendering site-wide while `/` carries on
answering 200, so nobody notices for hours. Millwright ships a guard for the
console entry that ends the whole class of it — see below.

## Compared with Extension Manager

Flarum's Extension Manager does run migrations, publish assets and clear caches
— but that work is wired to a **core** update. Installing or updating an
*extension* runs the Composer command and stops there.

| after the files land | Extension Manager | Millwright |
|---|---|---|
| install an extension | core migrates and publishes assets when you *enable* it | same, plus everything below |
| **update an extension** | **nothing** | migrations, assets, caches, formatter, code cache, health check |
| update Flarum itself | migrate, assets, cache clear | all of the above |
| PHP's compiled-code cache | never touched | waited for, then cleared |
| is the site still up afterwards | not checked | checked, and rolled back if not |

So the gap is on **updates**, not installs. Update an already-enabled extension
that ships a new migration or new JS, and the schema is left behind the code and
the browser keeps serving the old assets, with nothing saying so.

## Hosts without proc_open: "Runs without separate processes"

When the website's PHP cannot start another program (`proc_open` in `disable_functions`, or no command-line PHP to start), Millwright runs Composer inside the web request. That is safe here because Composer never touches `vendor/`: it only works out the new `composer.lock`, and Millwright downloads and swaps the packages itself, journalled, exactly as it does everywhere else. The limits:

- Composer shares the request's memory and time. Millwright lifts both while Composer runs where the host allows, and puts them back afterwards.
- The first update on a cold Composer cache is slow. Measured on a forum with 346 packages and 22 private GitHub repositories: about 145 seconds cold, 27 warm. If the host or the web server cuts the request short, nothing is changed: composer.json and composer.lock are put back, and the next poll of the Millwright page tries again (up to six times), each time with more of Composer's cache already downloaded.
- Git cannot run, so a Git source Composer would need git for is refused before anything changes, with the fix named: add a GitHub token under **Sources** so Composer reads the repository through GitHub's API, or serve the package from a Composer repository. Repositories marked `"no-api": true` always need git.
- Migrations, asset publishing and cache clearing run through Flarum's own console inside a fresh request after the swap, once PHP's compiled-code cache has let go of the old files. A queue worker leaves those steps to the admin page, so keep it open until the update finishes.

## Troubleshooting: Millwright says it can't run Composer in its own process

Open **Millwright → This host**. It names what is in the way, and what to change. None of these stop updates any more; fixing them moves Composer back into its own process.

**proc_open is disabled.** The website's PHP lists `proc_open` in `disable_functions`, so it cannot start any other program. Ask your host to remove it for this site. The row names the php.ini the setting comes from.

**No command-line PHP was found.** Composer runs under PHP's command-line program, and Millwright looks for the one that matches the PHP your site runs on. The usual reason it cannot find one on a hosting panel is `open_basedir`: the website's PHP is only allowed to look inside your site's own folders, so the command-line PHP is invisible to it even though it is installed. Millwright tries the likely paths anyway, and when none answers it shows the path open_basedir hid and the fix for your panel:

- **Plesk:** Websites & Domains → your domain → PHP Settings → `open_basedir`. Add `:/opt/plesk/php/8.5/bin/` to the end of the value (use the version your site runs), save, and reload the This host tab.
- **cPanel:** MultiPHP INI Editor → choose the domain → `open_basedir`. Add `:/opt/cpanel/ea-php85/root/usr/bin/` (your version), save, and reload. Some cPanel hosts only let support change it.
- **Anything else:** add the directory to `open_basedir` in the site's php.ini or PHP-FPM pool (`php_admin_value[open_basedir]`) and restart PHP-FPM.

If you know where the command-line PHP is, you can also enter its full path under **Command-line PHP path** on the same tab. Millwright runs it before saving and refuses anything that is not the command-line PHP, such as `php-fpm`.

**A command-line PHP was found but fails to run.** The row shows the error it printed, often a PHP extension that fails to load. Ask your host, with that error.

Testing over SSH does not settle any of this. The PHP you run over SSH is configured separately from the PHP that runs your website, so `proc_open` and `open_basedir` can be fine there and still block the site.

## How it works

### Applying a change is two renames, never a delete

```
vendor/<pkg>   →  trash/<pkg>@<version>     the old one is kept
staging/<pkg>  →  vendor/<pkg>              the new one arrives
```

Both are `rename()`, so each is atomic. The package is absent between them and
only between them — microseconds, for one package. Nothing is deleted during an
apply at all: the old version waits in the trash, which is what makes rollback
possible long after the fact.

### The journal is written before the act, and flushed to disk

A crash therefore leaves evidence of an *intention*, which is recoverable. A
journal written afterwards would leave a changed tree with no record of what
changed, which is not. Rollback replays it backwards, and its cost is
proportional to what changed rather than to the size of your `vendor/` — so it
works on a host with a disk quota where copying the tree would not.

### The trash is tidied, never what a rollback needs

Only the latest update can be rolled back, so the copies its journal names are
never removed. Neither is anything belonging to an update still in progress,
the most recent finished one, or anything that changed in the last day. Older
copies are kept for the last 30 days or the last 5 updates, whichever keeps
more (both are settings on the **This host** tab). What falls outside that is
removed after every update and nightly: copies only an older update refers to,
the `.rolledback` versions a rollback moved aside, and anything no update
refers to at all. Each update's summary is kept; its journal and staging go
with its copies.

```bash
php flarum millwright:prune --dry-run   # what would go, and how much room it frees
php flarum millwright:prune
```

The removal never follows a symlink and refuses any path that is not directly
inside the trash.

### Nothing loops

One request does exactly one unit of work and returns. Progress is a function of
how many times something calls the step endpoint — the admin page polling, a cron
tick, or a queue worker, interchangeably, and any of them can pick up a run
another started. A host that cuts every request at thirty seconds can therefore
finish an update that takes ten minutes, which no amount of making the update
faster would have achieved.

If you have a queue worker, it carries the work on when you close the tab. If you
do not, the page does it. **The queue is never what makes an update work** — that
distinction is the whole design.

## The root guard

Install it once, as root, on the site:

```bash
bash vendor/ernestdefoe/millwright/tools/install-root-guard.sh /var/www/html www-data
```

That patches the site's `flarum` console entry. From then on, a command run as
root heals any root-owned files an earlier root run stranded in `storage/`, then
drops to the web user *before* Flarum boots — so it writes exactly what php-fpm
would have written. Running it as the web user is unaffected; the guard does
nothing.

It is idempotent (re-running replaces the guard rather than stacking copies),
it lints the patched file before writing it and leaves the original in place if
the lint fails, and it is safe to call on every container boot. In Docker, call
it from your entrypoint so a rebuilt volume gets it back.

`millwright:repair-formatter` is the command this protects. Without the guard it
can only tell you which files to remove as root and exit 1 — it has no way to
remove them itself. With the guard, it just works, whoever typed it.

## What it deliberately does not do

**It will not touch an extension installed from a local path.** If
`vendor/you/thing` is a symlink into a checkout on the server — how extension
developers work — replacing it would leave your forum running a downloaded copy
while you carry on editing a directory nothing reads. Those are labelled *local
checkout* and offered no buttons.

**It does not flip symlinks between prepared slots.** This was planned, and
measurement killed it: `opcache.revalidate_path` is off by default, so PHP
resolves a symlink once and caches the result, and `realpath_cache_ttl` holds the
old target for two minutes more. A slot flip is atomic on disk and invisible to
PHP — it would trade a microsecond where a package is missing for minutes of
quietly serving the old code. Replacing a directory keeps the path constant, so
the ordinary timestamp check picks it up in seconds.

**It does not delete your data when you remove an extension.** Tables and
settings stay. This matches Extension Manager, and it is the reversible choice.

## Why it exists

Flarum's Extension Manager fails in a way that can take a site down, and the
failure is hard to diagnose from the admin screen.

This is not a criticism of the people who wrote it. It is an older design that
predates Flarum 2, and the specific code has not been changed upstream since
2024. A fix for the worst of it has been offered back —
[flarum/framework#5034](https://github.com/flarum/framework/pull/5034) — but the
rest cannot be fixed without changing the shape of the thing, which is why this
is a separate extension rather than a patch.

The mechanism, specifically: it runs Composer inside the PHP worker serving the
request, caps memory from inside that process, and swaps the vendor directory by
**deleting it and moving a new one over the top** — leaving the forum with no
`vendor/` at all for as long as that takes. If the job is killed inside that
window the site stops booting; the task row still says `running`, and every later
update is silently refused because something looks busy.

Millwright is built the other way round.

## Tests

```bash
composer install && vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The suite that matters is `CrashRecoveryTest`. It runs a real apply in a
subprocess and **SIGKILLs it at every step in the sequence** — before anything is
touched, after the old version is stashed but before the new one lands, after it
lands but before the journal records it, and after the record is complete — then
rolls back and asserts the tree is byte-for-byte what it was.

A thrown exception would be a weaker test: it unwinds the stack and runs
destructors, which a host killing an overrunning request does not.

`ResumabilityTest` goes further and kills at *random* points, repeatedly, until a
run completes — a better model of a real host, where the cut lands wherever the
clock happens to be. One case kills in the single gap that matters: between doing
an item and recording it. That item is then redone on resume, and the test
asserts the repeat rather than pretending it cannot happen. Everything in the
applier is built so a repeat is a no-op.
